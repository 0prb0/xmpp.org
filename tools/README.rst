Software Directory README
#########################

To help software authors maintain their software entries, scripts are provided which help you with creating a proper pull request.

All software entries are contained in ``software.json`` (`edit software entries directly on GitHub <https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/edit/master/data/software.json>`_)

A note on the ``platforms`` key: For clients and servers, this is the list of platforms a project runs on. For libraries, this is the list of languages they support.

**Note:** You can of course also manually edit the JSON files if thatâ€™s what you prefer. Make sure to keep the diff minimal. All times are UTC.


Modifying your existing entry
============================

For changing an existing entry, you can use the ``update_entry.py`` tool from the command line. Example::

  ./update_entry.py Conversations

The tool will ask for confirmation::

  --- before
  +++ after

   {
  -    "doap": null,
  +    "doap"; "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iNPUTmice/Conversations/master/conversations.doap",
       "name": "Conversations",
       "platforms": [
           "Android"
       ],
       "url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations",
       "categories": [
           "client"
       ]
   }
  is this okay? [y/n]

After confirmation, it writes the changes to the ``software.json``. You can then add and commit the changes to git as usual. **Validate** that your entry is correct using ``./lint_software_list.py`` and then make a Pull Request on GitHub.


Updating information
--------------------

When asking the tool for ``--help``, you will notice that it supports a few other options too::

  usage: update_entry.py [-h] [--rename NAME] [--set-url URL] [--set-doap URL]
                         [--set-platforms PLATFORM [PLATFORM ...]]
                         [--no-ask]
                         [NAME]

  Modify a software entry in the software list.

  positional arguments:
    NAME                  Current name of the project

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --rename NAME         Rename the project
    --set-url URL         Change the URL of the project
    --set-doap URL        Change the URL of the project DOAP file
    --set-platforms PLATFORM [PLATFORM ...]
                          Change the contents of the last column
    --no-ask              Do not ask for confirmation before applying changes.

The following options are useful for updating information about your project:

* ``--rename``: If you need to change the name in the registry, this option is for you. It will not allow you to replace another project.
* ``--set-url``: Change the URL to which your project links.
* ``--set-platforms``: Set the words shown in the third column: if your project is a client or server, this is the list of platforms it runs on. if your project is a library, this is the language(s) it supports.

  Example use::

    ./update_entry.py Pidgin --set-platforms 'Windows' 'Linux'

Do not set ``--no-ask`` and always be sure to review that your changes do what you intend them to do.

If you do not know how to spell your project correctly, leave out the ``NAME`` argument; the tool will list the project it knows.

Do not forget to **validate** that your entry is correct using the ``./lint_software_list.py`` and then make a Pull Request on GitHub.


Add a new entry
===============

There is no tooling for that. Add the following template to the respective ``json`` file:

.. code-block:: json

      {
          "name": "My Fancy New Client",
          "doap": "https://myfancyclient.example/doap.rdf",
          "platforms": [
            "GNU Hurd",
            "Plan9"
          ],
          "url": "https://myfancyclient.example",
          "categories": [
            "client"
          ]
      }

Insert it into the top-level JSON Array as last element by adding a comma after the last ``,`` and then pasting the above template with your modifications. Use the tool as described in the previous section to perform a modification (this will sort the list correctly to minimize future diffs).

**If you do not use the tool**, make sure that you adhere to the sorting requirements of the JSON file. You can use the ``lint_software_list.py`` tool to verify that everything is in order. If ``lint_software_list.py`` complains, the CI will reject your Pull Request.

Finally, create a Pull Request.

**Note**: The JSON file must be saved using UTF-8 character encoding, without a Byte Order Mark (BOM). Using other character encodings, or including a BOM
may result in the failure of the validation procedure, which will cause the pull request to be rejected.

Remove an existing entry
========================

Simply drop the corresponding JSON Object from the array and make a PR. Use the ``./lint_software_list.py`` tool to ensure that the syntax is still valid.


Validating Entries
==================

To validate that the list contents are okay, use the ``lint_software_list.py`` tool::

  ./lint_software_list.py
