## The whole list

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its XEP series. This page lists Stable and Final XEPs as well as experimental proposals that are currently under consideration.

Good places for developers to start are the [compliance suites](https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites-current), as well as the [technology overview pages](https://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/technology-overview/). Furthermore, we would like to suggest the independent [Modern XMPP project](https://docs.modernxmpp.org/) which attempts to improve the quality of user-to-user messaging applications that use XMPP.
