Welcome to the 3rd edition of the XMPP newsletter.

Jeff Becker has written a howto called
[New life for XMPP. Build your own decentralized messenger!](https://i2p.rocks/blog/new-life-for-xmpp-build-your-own-decentralized-messenger.html)
which focuses on using the [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/) anonymous network layer instead of using a registered domain name.

Peter Waher has published his book _"Mastering Internet of Things"_, available from [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-internet-things)
and [Amazon](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-internet-things).

Georg Lukas has written a post [Freedom and Anonymity on XMPP](https://github.com/ge0rg/jabber-spam-fighting-manifesto/blob/master/Freedom-and-Anonymity.md)
in which he addresses concerns around his [Jabber Spam Fighting Manifesto](https://github.com/ge0rg/jabber-spam-fighting-manifesto)
and its possible effects on issues of privacy and free speech.

The USA's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released a [draft report on cybersecurity or the Internet of Things (IoT)](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/nistir/8200/draft/documents/nistir8200-draft.pdf). Daniel Wisnewski from Tigase has written an [analysis with focus on using XMPP for IoT](https://tigase.net/article/nist-releases-iot-draft-standards).
