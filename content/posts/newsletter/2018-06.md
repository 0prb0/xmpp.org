Welcome to the XMPP newsletter.

## News

* [Decentralized code forge, based on XMPP](https://www.goffi.org/b/F4xScokjZejCYAB4NamBbc/decentralized-code-forge,-based-xmpp)

Github has been acquired by Microsoft, prompting some FOSS developers with long
memories to reconsider whether they still want to host their projects there.

The Salut à Toi project is working on a decentralized and federated solution for issues and
merge requests, based on XMPP, and Jérôme Poisson explains in this article
their motivation for doing this work.

* [Project MAXS](http://projectmaxs.org/introduction.html), which stands for *Modular Android XMPP Suite*, allows you to control your Android device and receive notifications over XMPP.

* [XMPP vs Firebase: Choosing the right platform for real-time chat apps](https://www.techcronus.com/blog/real-time-chat-application-development-xmpp-firebase)

Every now and then a blog post comparing XMPP and Firebase appears. Generally
these posts seem to be poorly disguised attempts at SEO and to promote application
development by a particular devshop. This submission seems to follow the trend
and is also relatively superficial. It is however interesting to note that they
mention multiple times that it's difficult to set up an XMPP server. Perhaps
something to take note of and to consider how we could ease setup of an
XMPP-based solution.

* [Monal now has initial OMEMO support](https://monal.im/blog/monal-has-omemo/)

Monal has received a lot of updates last months and now it
also has initial OMEMO support. More work needs to be done, so don't expect to
see this in the App Store before August however.

* Paul Schaub continues writing about his Summer of Code adventures:

## Extensions and Specifications

XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload just entered "Last Call for comments". This
specification defines a protocol to request permissions from another entity to
upload a file to a specific path on an HTTP server and at the same time receive
a URL from which that file can later be downloaded again. This Last Call shall
end at the close of business on 2018-06-19. 1. Is this specification needed to
fill gaps in the XMPP protocol stack or to clarify an existing protocol? 2.
Does the specification solve the problem stated in the introduction and
requirements? 3. Do you plan to implement this specification in your code? If
not, why not? 4. Do you have any security concerns related to this
specification? 5. Is the specification accurate and clearly written?

Andrew Nenakhov from Redsolution, creators of Xabber, announced on the Standards
mailing-list that they are working on a Group Chat solution.

XEP-0409: IM Routing-NG
