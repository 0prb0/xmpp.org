## Extensions and Specifications

XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload just entered "Last Call for comments". This
specification defines a protocol to request permissions from another entity to
upload a file to a specific path on an HTTP server and at the same time receive
a URL from which that file can later be downloaded again. This Last Call shall
end at the close of business on 2018-06-19. 1. Is this specification needed to
fill gaps in the XMPP protocol stack or to clarify an existing protocol? 2.
Does the specification solve the problem stated in the introduction and
requirements? 3. Do you plan to implement this specification in your code? If
not, why not? 4. Do you have any security concerns related to this
specification? 5. Is the specification accurate and clearly written?

Andrew Nenakhov from Redsolution, creators of Xabber, announced on the Standards
mailing-list that they are working on a Group Chat solution.

XEP-0409: IM Routing-NG
