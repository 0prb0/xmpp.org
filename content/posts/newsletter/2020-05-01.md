# Extensions and specifications

### Updated

- Version 0.2.0 of XEP-0437 (Room Activity Indicators) has been released.
Abstract:
This specification describes a lightweight mechanism for activity notifications in MUCs
Changelog:
* Assign urn:xmpp namespace instead of xmpp:prosody.im namespace (this was missed during acceptance) (XEP Editor (jsc))

- Version 0.1.1 of XEP-0438 (Best practices for password hashing and storage) has been released.
Abstract:

URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0438.html

- Version 1.2.0 of XEP-0167 (Jingle RTP Sessions) has been released.
Abstract:
This specification defines a Jingle application type for negotiating one or more sessions that use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to exchange media such as voice or video. The application type includes a straightforward mapping to Session Description Protocol (SDP) for interworking with SIP media endpoints.
Changelog:
* Introduce <rtcp-mux/> element to signal the ability to multiplex RTP Data and Control Packets. (dg)
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0167.html

- Version 2.10.0 of XEP-0004 (Data Forms) has been released.
Abstract:
This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for data forms that can be used in workflows such as service configuration as well as for application-specific data description and reporting. The protocol includes lightweight semantics for forms processing (such as request, response, submit, and cancel), defines several common field types
(boolean, list options with single or multiple choice, text with single line or multiple lines, single or multiple JabberIDs, hidden fields, etc.), provides extensibility for future data types, and can be embedded in a wide range of applications. The protocol is not intended to provide complete forms-processing functionality as is provided in the W3C XForms technology, but instead provides a basic subset of such functionality for use by XMPP entities.
Changelog:
* Clarify that fields which are not required may be omitted on submission. (fs)
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html
