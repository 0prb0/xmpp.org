Happy 2019 and welcome to the XMPP newsletter.

If you have an article, tutorial or blog post you'd like us to include in the
newsletter, please [submit it on the XMPP wiki](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).

## News

The Prosody team has written a blog post [welcoming 2019](https://blog.prosody.im/welcoming-2019/)
where they look back at the progress made in 2018 and forward towards what can be expected in 2019.

Logitech's Harmony Hub home automation device uses XMPP and they
apparently inadvertently allowed local access to customers.

When a 3rd party cyber security firm found multiple vulnerabilities,
[Logitech made a firmware update that disabled XMPP access](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/12/logitech-firmware-update-breaks-locally-controlled-harmony-hub-systems/)
thereby angering many users who had added extra functionality via XMPP.

In response Logitech has created a new
[XMPP beta program](https://community.logitech.com/s/question/0D55A00008D4bZ4SAJ/harmony-hub-firmware-update-fixes-vulnerabilities)
that will give users access to the local controls that were removed and they
plan to release an official firmware update with XMPP controls this month.

Tumblr started blocking adult content on December 17th, which caused
many users to complain of false positives and prompted some to look for alternatives.
In response Timoth√©e Jaussoin wrote a [blog post suggesting that Tumblr users migrate to Movim](https://nl.movim.eu/?node/pubsub.movim.eu/Movim/hey-tumblr-users-here-is-why-movim-could-be-the-best-platform-to-migrate-to-BpGnsH).
The post was subsequently [discussed on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18601515)
and was on its front page for a while.

Linux Journal has published an article [Lessons in Vendor Lock-in: Messaging](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lessons-vendor-lock-messaging),
in which the author gives a quick history of instant messaging as he has
experienced it and laments the fact that open and standardized messaging
hasn't taken off as expected.
