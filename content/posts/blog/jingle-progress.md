One of the high-priority items on our [roadmap](http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/roadmap.shtml) for 2007 is completing work on [Jingle](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html), the set of XMPP extensions for voice and video that we first published in late 2005. Although it's taken us about 16 months, we are getting [quite close](http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2007-April/014927.html) to advancing the Jingle specifications to Draft status within our standards process. Jingle, originally based on the technology defined by [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) team, is now widely used in the [One Laptop Per Child](http://www.laptop.org/) project as well as in the Nokia 770 and the Nokia 800.

Today we updated five of the main Jingle specs:[Jingle core](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html), [Jingle Audio via RTP](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0167.html), [Jingle Video via RTP](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0180.html), [Jingle ICE Transport](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0176.html), and [Jingle Raw UDP Transport](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0177.html).

These specs should be ready for Last Call very soon now, so stay tuned for further updates.
