FYI, if you're a fan of [Strophe.js and/or libstrophe](http://strophe.im/) then you need to make sure to update your bookmarks as the site has moved. You can now find all of the Strophe goodness at [strophe.im](http://strophe.im/).

UPDATE: The hsxmpp project has moved too, the new site is [http://חנוך.se/hsxmpp/](http://חנוך.se/hsxmpp/).
