**XMPP** is an excellent protocol for use within *Internet of Things*. The aim of this page, is to give a brief introduction to how XMPP can help build solid, secure and interoperable devices, services and applications for the *Internet of Things*.


## A definition for the Internet of Things

While early pioneers into the field later named *Internet of Things*, or **IoT**, were quick to outline their visions of what the Internet of Things could become, the subject has lacked a clear *definition* of what it is, a definition with clear ramifications and consequences that can be studied, and under which different solutions can be compared. Before we embark on the journey of making claims of which protocol is the best for IoT, or if a protocol is good or bad at all, we need to establish some common ground. We therefore make the following definition:

: Internet of Things :
:--------------------:
:The *Internet of Things* (or **IoT**) is what we get when we *connect* *Things*, that are *not operated by humans*, to the *Internet*. :

This definition has some direct consequences that open up into different areas of study:

* **Connection** relates to the study of *communication protocols*.
* **Things** relates to the study of *sensors*, *actuators*, *controllers* and other types of devices.
* **Not operated by humans** relates to *provisioning* and *automatic decision making*.
* **Internet** relates to *security*, including identities, authentication and authorization, but also to *interoperability*.

As you will see, **XMPP** provides a lot of support into all these areas, making it well suited for use withing the area of *Internet of Things*.
