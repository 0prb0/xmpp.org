Unless it can be demonstrated that there is an error in the license form or that it is commercially unreasonable in your situation, the terms of the license form are not negotiable, since we do not have the time and money to enter into negotiated licenses. The fee is set at such a low level that the legal costs of changing or negotiating modifications to the license are in most cases prohibitive. If any changes are to be made in the license, and that is unlikely, the user and proposed licensee will be required to pay all legal costs incurred by the XMPP Standards Foundation in discussing and/or making any modifications. Therefore, please do not ask for changes in it unless there is some critical reason for doing so. We do not expect to make many exceptions.
