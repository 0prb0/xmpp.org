XMPP is a set of open technologies for instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice/video calls and collaboration.
More technically, XMPP is also for lightweight middleware, content syndication and generalised multi-domain routing of XML data.

XMPP was originally developed in the Jabber open-source community to provide an open, decentralized alternative to the closed instant messaging services at that time.

XMPP offers several key advantages over such services:

- __Open__ — the XMPP protocols are free, open, public, and easily understandable. In addition, multiple implementations exist in the form of clients, servers, server components, and code libraries
- __Secure__ — any XMPP server may be isolated from the public network (e.g. on a company intranet). Robust, peer reviewed, industry-standard  security using SASL and TLS has been built into the core XMPP specifications and in addition, the XMPP developer community is actively working on end-to-end encryption to raise the security bar even further
- __Standard__ — the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has formalised the core XML streaming protocols as an approved instant messaging and presence technology, and both the IETF and the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) are actively involved in maintaining the protocol
- __Community__ — the first Jabber/XMPP technologies were developed by Jeremie Miller in 1998 and are now stable technologies; hundreds of developers are working on these technologies, there are tens of thousands of XMPP servers running on the Internet today and millions of people use XMPP for instant messaging through public services such as Google Talk and XMPP deployments at organisations worldwide
- __Decentralized__ — the architecture of the XMPP network is similar to email, and as a result anyone can run their own XMPP server; enabling individuals and organisations to take control of their communications experience
- __Extensible__ — anyone can build custom functionality on top of the core protocols. To maintain interoperability common extensions are published in the XEP series, but such publication is not required and organisations can maintain their own private extensions if they wish (although we encourage sharing as much as possible!)
- __Flexible__ — XMPP applications beyond IM include network management, content syndication, collaboration tools, file sharing, gaming, remote systems monitoring, web services, lightweight middleware, cloud computing, and much more
- __Diverse__ — a wide range of companies and open-source projects use XMPP to build and deploy real-time applications and services; you will never get “locked in” when you use XMPP technologies (hurrah!)
- __Mature__ - XMPP has been deployed for more than 15 years, by tens of thousands of services, and this experience is fed back into the protocol to benefit its users
