The XMPP Standards Foundation (also known as the XSF and formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is an independent, nonprofit standards development organisation whose primary mission is to define open protocols for presence, instant messaging, and real-time communication and collaboration on top of the IETFâ€™s Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

The XSF also provides information and infrastructure to the worldwide community of Jabber/XMPP developers, service providers and end users.

At the core of the XSF is its elected Membership who, in turn, elect a Council (the technical leadership) and Board (the business leadership). 

If you have an interest in XMPP standards, it is straightforward to [become a Member of the XSF](/community/membership).

Ralph has been member of the XMPP Council since 2004 and is a software developer for Rackspace. You can find him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ralphm) and chat with him on [XMPP]()

## The Council:
