The XMPP Standards Foundation (also known as the XSF and formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is an independent, nonprofit standards development organisation whose primary mission is to define open protocols for presence, instant messaging, and real-time communication and collaboration on top of the IETFâ€™s Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

The XSF also provides information and infrastructure to the worldwide community of Jabber/XMPP developers, service providers, and end users. In addition, the XSF administers the [Jabber Trademark Licensing Program](/about/xsf/jabber-trademark).

At the core of the XSF is its elected Membership who, in turn, elect a Council (the technical leadership) and Board (the business leadership). The Board also appoints various work teams (such as the [editor team](/about/xsf/editor-team) and [infrastructure team](/about/xsf/infrastructure-team)) as well as the [Executive Director, Treasurer, and Secretary](/about/xsf/people).

If you have an interest in XMPP standards, it is straightforward to [become a Member of the XSF](/community/membership). (See a [list of XSF members here](/about/xsf/members))
