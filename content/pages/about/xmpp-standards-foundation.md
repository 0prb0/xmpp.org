The XMPP Standards Foundation (also known as the XSF and formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is an independent, nonprofit standards development organisation whose primary mission is to define open protocols for presence, instant messaging, and real-time communication and collaboration on top of the IETFâ€™s Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

The XSF also provides information and infrastructure to the worldwide community of Jabber/XMPP developers, service providers and end users.

At the core of the XSF is its elected Membership who, in turn, elect a Council (the technical leadership) and Board (the business leadership). 

If you have an interest in XMPP standards, it is straightforward to [become a Member of the XSF](/community/membership). (See a [list of XSF members here](/about/xsf/members))

## The Board

The Board of Directors of the XMPP Standards Foundation oversees the business affairs of the organisation. As elected by the XSF membership, the Board of Directors for 2014-2015 consists of the following individuals:

- __Ralph Meijer__ is the lead developer of several Jabber-related projects and services, including Wokkel and the XMPP support in Twisted, the Idavoll pubsub component, and Planet Jabber. Ralph has been member of the XMPP Council since 2004 and is a software developer for Rackspace. You can find him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ralphm) and chat with him on [XMPP]()
- __Adam Brault__ is the founder of [&yet](http://andyet.com), a consultancy focused on realtime communication (XMPP, WebRTC) and security. You can find Adam on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/adambrault) and chat with him on [XMPP](xmpp:adam@brault.io). (Sometimes.)

## The Council:

The XMPP Council is the technical steering group that approves XMPP Extension Protocols. The Council is governed by the XSF Bylaws and XEP-0001, as augmented by various policies and procedures. 

The Council is elected by the members of the XMPP Standards Foundation. In the interest of transparency, chatroom logs and mailing list archives are available (anyone can subscribe to the mailing list, but only Council members can post).

The Council (2014-2015) consists of the following individuals:
