The XMPP Standards Foundation (also known as the XSF and formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is an independent, nonprofit standards development organisation whose primary mission is to define open protocols for presence, instant messaging, and real-time communication and collaboration on top of the IETF’s Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

The XSF also provides information and infrastructure to the worldwide community of Jabber/XMPP developers, service providers and end users.

At the core of the XSF is its elected Membership who, in turn, elect a Council (the technical leadership) and Board (the business leadership).

If you have an interest in XMPP standards, it is straightforward to [become a Member of the XSF](/community/membership). (See a [list of XSF members here](/about/xsf/members))

## The Board

The Board of Directors of the XMPP Standards Foundation oversees the business affairs of the organisation. As elected by the XSF membership, the Board of Directors for 2014-2015 consists of the following individuals:

- __Laura Crossley (Chair)__
- __Ralph Meijer__ is the lead developer of several Jabber-related projects and services, including Wokkel and the XMPP support in Twisted, the Idavoll pubsub component, and Planet Jabber. Ralph has been member of the XMPP Council since 2004 and is a software developer for Rackspace. You can find him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ralphm) and chat with him on [XMPP]()
- __Simon Tennant__
- __Will Sheward__
- __Adam Brault__ is the founder of [&yet](http://andyet.com), a consultancy focused on realtime communication (XMPP, WebRTC) and security. You can find Adam on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/adambrault) and chat with him on [XMPP](xmpp:adam@brault.io). (Sometimes.)

## The Council:

The XMPP Council is the technical steering group that approves XMPP Extension Protocols. The Council is governed by the XSF Bylaws and XEP-0001, as augmented by various policies and procedures.

The Council is elected by the members of the XMPP Standards Foundation. In the interest of transparency, chatroom logs and mailing list archives are available (anyone can subscribe to the mailing list, but only Council members can post).

The Council (2014-2015) consists of the following individuals:

- __Kevin Smith (Chair)__ is Chair of the XMPP Council for 2014-2015, reprising his role from 2008-2014, having previously served as a Council member for 2006-2008. Kev works at [Isode](http://isode.com) where he’s responsible for the [M-Link server](http://www.isode.com/products/m-link.html), other XMPP projects and work on the open-source [Swift]() XMPP client. He was formerly the project leader on [Psi](). Kevin is also the author of several [XMPP extensions](/extensions) and co-authored [XMPP: The Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596521271.do).
- __Philipp Hancke__ got involved in XMPP via the [psyced server](http://www.psyced.org/) in 2004, which led him to author a number of specifications related to server-to-server connections. He works at [&yet](https://andyet.com/) where he is a WebRTC consultant and lead developer on &yet's [Talky](http://talky.io) videochat service using a combination of Jingle and WebRTC.
- __Lance Stout__ has worked on several XMPP client/component libraries since 2010, including [SleekXMPP](https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP). Lance works at [&yet](http://andyet.com) where he has been focusing on improving the experience of developing with XMPP in the browser, which has resulted in the new [stanza.io](http://stanza.io) library. With the recent introduction of WebRTC, he has been working with Philipp to create interoperable implementations of Jingle using WebRTC.
- __Matthew Wild__ is a founder of the [Prosody XMPP server](http://prosody.im/) project and a number of [smaller XMPP projects](http://code.matthewwild.co.uk/). Matthew has been a member of the XMPP Council since 2009, has authored and co-authored various [XEPs](http://xmpp.org/extensions/) and helps maintain the [Jabber.org IM service](http://jabber.org/).
