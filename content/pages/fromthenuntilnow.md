Title: From then until now
Slug: from-then-until-now

####1999
*January*: Jeremie Miller announces the existence of Jabber; an open technology for instant messaging and presence. Throughout the year development moves quickly on an open source server (jabberd), several open-source clients and code libraries, and open wire protocols for real-time XML streaming; as well as basic instant messaging and presence extensions. These same base protocols (with various improvements and extensions) are still in use today.

*August*: Jeremie submits a statement pledging the Jabber community’s support for the IETF standards process. This statement is consistent with the founding mission of the Jabber project: to foster freedom of conversation and support open standards and interoperability in real-time communications.

####2000
*February*: The IETF publish work done by the Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol (IMPP) Working Group; in short, a model and set of requirements for instant messaging and presence systems.
May: Version 1.0 of the jabberd server is released and the base Jabber protocols (XML streaming, messaging, presence, contact lists, etc.) are stabilised. 

*October*: jabberd 1.2 is released and the server dialback protocol introduced to prevent address spoofing on the rapidly growing network of Jabber servers.

####2001
*August*: The Jabber Software Foundation (JSF) is formed to coordinate the growing number of open source projects and commercial entities building/using the Jabber technologies. The key focus of the JSF is to manage the protocols used within the Jabber/XMPP community, by documenting existing protocols and developing protocol extensions through an open standards process.

####2002
*October*: Formation of the XMPP Working Group is approved by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). As a result, JSF formally contributes the base Jabber protocols to the Internet Standards Process and assigns change control over those protocols to the IETF, under the name Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). 

*November*: First meeting of the XMPP Working Group is held at IETF 55 and includes presentations by Jeremie Miller, Joe Hildebrand, and Peter Saint-Andre.

####2003
XMPP Working Group essentially completes work on formalising the base Jabber protocols for adaptation, as IETF-approved instant messaging and presence protocols; later revisions made to the base protocols focus on improving security and internationalisation. 

Jabber submits an IPR Notice to the IETF regarding the JABBER trademark.

####2004
Upon publication of the XMPP RFCs, the IETF announces the conclusion of the XMPP Working Group. However, development of further XMPP extensions continues.

####2005
*August*: Implementation and deployment of large-scale XMPP-based services continues, highlighted by the launch of Google Talk.

####2006
*July*: The first XMPP Summit was held in Portland, Oregon, USA.

*October*: JSF renames “Jabber Enhancement Proposals” (JEPs) to “XMPP Extension Protocols” (XEPs) and moves them to the xmpp.org website.

*December*: JSF enters into a partnership with StartCom, to offer free digital certificates to administrators of Jabber/XMPP servers through the XMPP Intermediate Certification Authority.

####2007
*January*: Jabber Software Foundation renames itself to XMPP Standards Foundation to more accurately describe its focus on developing open protocol extensions to the IETF’s base XMPP specifications, rather than open-source software.

*February*: XSF hold the second XMPP Summit in Brussels, Belgium.

*July*: XSF hold the third XMPP Summit in Portland, Oregon, USA.

####2008
*February*: XSF hold the fourth XMPP Summit in Brussels, Belgium.

*July*: XSF hold the fifth XMPP Summit in Portland, Oregon, USA.

####2009
*February*: XSF hold the sixth XMPP Summit in Brussels, Belgium.

*July*: XSF held the seventh XMPP Summit in San Jose, California, USA.

####2010
*February*: XSF hold the eighth XMPP Summit in Brussels, Belgium.

*July*: XSF hold the ninth XMPP Summit in Portland, Oregon, USA.

####2011
*February*: XSF hold the tenth XMPP Summit in Brussels, co-located with an interim meeting of the IETF’s XMPP Working Group, with a special focus on internationalization.

####2012
*February*: XSF hold the eleventh XMPP Summit in Brussels, Belgium.

*February*: XSF complete significant revisions to the XMPP multi-user chat extension.
