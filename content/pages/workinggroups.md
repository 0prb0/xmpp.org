Title: Working Groups
Slug: working-groups

##Responsibilities of Members
Because the XSF is a membership organisation, our members provide the legal basis for our activities. In particular, the members of the XSF annually elect the XMPP Council and the XSF Board of Directors. 

Membership in the XMPP Standards Foundation is a privilege that is granted by existing members to active participants in the Jabber/XMPP community. Prospective members are expected to have made valuable contributions through writing code, deploying Jabber/XMPP services, creating documentation, authoring XMPP Extension Protocols, and so on. The best way to increase your chances of election are to actively and visibly contribute to the Jabber/XMPP community.

##XSF Work Teams
Once elected, XSF members are expected to continue contributing to the Jabber/XMPP community and the work of the XMPP Standards Foundation through participation on our discussion portals and in the XSFâ€™s work teams. 

Currently three work teams are chartered and active:
* Editor Team
* Infrastructure Team
* UPnP Liaison Team
