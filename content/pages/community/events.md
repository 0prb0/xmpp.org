## XMPP Summits

The XSF organizes periodic in-person gatherings in order to coordinate high-bandwidth conversations, interop testing, brainstorming and planning, and to conduct other XSF business face-to-face.

The next event is the [US XMPP Summit](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summit_18) in Richland, WA in October. 

The last event (Summit 17) was the [European XMPP Summit](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summit_17), held in coordination with [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) in Brussels.

It is anticipated that Summit 19 will be held once again in Brussels in February 2016.
