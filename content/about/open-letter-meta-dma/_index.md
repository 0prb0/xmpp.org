# Open Letter to Meta: Support True Messaging Interoperability with XMPP

The European Digital Markets Act (DMA) is designed to break down walled gardens and enforce messaging interoperability. As a designated gatekeeper, Meta—controlling WhatsApp and Messenger—must comply. However, its current proposal falls short, risking further entrenchment of its dominance rather than fostering genuine competition.

## The Problem with Meta’s Interoperability Plan

Meta's proposed approach relies on restrictive NDAs, proprietary APIs, and centralized control. This is **not true interoperability**—it is a closed system that forces third parties to operate within Meta’s terms, undermining the spirit of the DMA. Key issues include:

- **Gatekeeper Agreements:** Companies must sign NDAs to access interoperability details, creating artificial barriers.

- **API-Based Control:** APIs limit flexibility, can be modified unilaterally, and do not scale for true federation.

- **User Tracking Risks:** The approach risks exposing external users to Meta’s data collection practices.

- **Scalability Issues:** Maintaining separate API bridges for each provider is inefficient and prevents sustainable competition.

## The Solution: XMPP Federation

Meta does not need to reinvent interoperability. The **eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)** is a **proven, open standard** that has powered global federated messaging for 25 years. XMPP enables **direct server-to-server communication**, removing the need for restrictive agreements and ensuring:

- **Seamless federation** across providers, just like email or phone networks.

- **Decentralized control**, where each service provider can enforce its own policies.

- **Enhanced privacy** by avoiding unnecessary data exposure.

- **Scalability and flexibility**, ensuring long-term sustainability.

## Meta Has Already Used XMPP—Why Not Now?

Meta has previously **supported XMPP in Facebook Messenger** and **WhatsApp was built on an XMPP-based server**. The protocol is already battle-tested at scale. Furthermore, **Meta is embracing federation for Threads with ActivityPub**, proving that interoperability works when it serves Meta’s strategic interests.

If Threads can federate, so can Messenger and WhatsApp.

## A Call to Action

We urge Meta to **adopt XMPP for messaging interoperability**. The **XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF)** is ready to collaborate, evolve the protocol to meet modern needs, and ensure true compliance with the DMA. Let’s build an open, competitive messaging ecosystem—one that empowers users, not just gatekeepers.

It’s time for real interoperability. Let’s make it happen.
