Furthermore, the XSF will have its dinner Thursday night which is paid for XSF members. Everyone else is of course invited to participate, however at their own expense. Please reach out if you are participating as a non-member (see list below).

### Participation

**Please compulsory register before Monday 15th January 2024!**

Please note that, although we welcome everyone to join, you must announce your attendance beforehand, as the venue is not publicly accessible. If you're interested in attending, 
please make yourself known by filling out your details on the [wiki page for Summit 26](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Conferences/Summit_26). To edit the page, reach out to an XSF member 
to enter and update your details or you'll need a wiki account, which we'll happily provide for you. Reach out in the [XSF public chatroom](https://xmpp.org/chat#converse/room?jid=xsf@muc.xmpp.org).
When you sign-up please book the accomodation and your travel. Please also unsign if you will not attend anymore.
